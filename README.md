## Build gate

```bash
node scripts/check.mjs        # installs (if needed), builds, lints every package
```

## Frontend (dev)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. Hebrew is the document direction (`lang="he"` `dir="rtl"`). English prefix `/en` arrives in step 03.
In dev, http://localhost:5173/styleguide shows the brand tokens and primitives. It is omitted from production builds.

Run instructions for the API services are added as they land (see "Current Progress" in `system_architecture.md`).
